Otherwise, it appears to be fairly healthy. It is growing up a slope from a stream that flows with at least a trickle of water year round. There is little visible damage on this tree besides the trimming for the trail. As for other species' health, this forest is fairly healthy. There are very few dead snags besides those that have fallen in the recent windstorms we've been experiencing. However, I do believe that this forest could be at risk in the future due to the abundance of invasive himalayan blackberry and english ivy, which have choked out some native wildflower species.
