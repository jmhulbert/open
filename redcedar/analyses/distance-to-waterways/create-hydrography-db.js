/**
 * Prerequisites for running this file include running:
 *
 * `$ node fetch-hydrography.js`
 * 
 * Create a [spatial-db](./spatial-db) instance that holds the WA DNR
 * water courses and water bodies features, giving the ability to fetch
 * individual features from the database, as well as search for k nearest
 * kneighbors to a particular [lon, lat] position.
 *
 * Water course features are added to the line feature spatial index.
 *
 * Water body features with a period label (WB_PERIOD_LABEL_NM) value
 * of "Dry land" are removed, since we are looking for relationships to
 * wet areas. They are saved as polygons to do intersection tests and indexed
 * under the polygon feature spatial index. Each polygon is also converted
 * into a line and indexed alongside other line features in the line feature
 * spatial index.
 *
 * All features that are included in the spatial index are also accessible by
 * the index value they hold in the spatial index, this is an affordance of 
 * [flatbush](https://github.com/mourner/flatbush) which provides spatial
 * indexing functionality.
 *
 * The entire database is written to `hydrography-db`.
