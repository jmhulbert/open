# Approach

The overall approach is to model empirical data collected by community scientists with ancillary climate data to identify important predictors of western redcedar dieback.

## iNat Data - Empirical Tree Points

The steps for wrangling the [data](https://jmhulbert.github.io/open/redcedar/data) are described [here](https://jmhulbert.github.io/open/redcedar/data).

These data were then subset to include only gps information to use in collecting ancillary data.
