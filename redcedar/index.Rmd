### Redcedar dieback

Increased levels of western redcedar dieback [have been linked to recent longer and hotter summer droughts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.11.522134v1.full.pdf), which is tragic considering the cultural and ecological importance of this species.  Many critical questions remain about its vulnerability and survival going forward.

### Community Science

More than 250 community scientists have [shared observations of healthy and unhealthy redcedar](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map). These observations are invaluable for conducting spatial analyses to better understand the dieback of redcedar and reduce the impacts on our environments and communities.

### Open Analyses

Given so many people have dedicated their time to helping learn about the dieback of western redcedar, it is important we include their data transparently in any analyses.

The purpose of this page is to organize efforts to conduct open analyses of the western redcedar dieback data shared on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/western-redcedar-dieback-map).

### Community

Anyone is welcome to contribute to these analyses. Together as a community, we are grateful for anyone willing to help.
